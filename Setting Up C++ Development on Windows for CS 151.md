## Setting up Compilation
The steps found in this section can also be found [in the VSCode MSYS2 documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw#_prerequisites). 
___
### Setting up VSCode (pt. 1)
You probably already have VSCode installed. If not, [download and install it](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). 
You also likely have the C++ extension installed. If not, it can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools).
### Set Up MinGW Toolchain
MinGW provides native Windows support for many Linux tools, such as the GCC (Gnu Compiler Collection). This includes the G++ compiler, which is what you've used in WSL up until now. We're installing this in favor of MSVC, which is a Microsoft-developed compiler typically used used with Visual Studio. G++ will allow us to copy terminal commands for compilation provided by the instructor. 

Keep in mind that there are some parts of the standard library that differ between platforms. One example is the usage of `uint*x*_t`; on Linux, this can be used as-needed, but on Windows, you will need to include `cstdint.h` to use these typedefs. The C++ linter should help when dtermining platform-specific errors. 

#### Install MSYS2 
Installing G++ on Windows involves downloading [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/), which is used to manage the installation and updating of the tools that MinGW provides. [The installer can be downloaded here.](https://github.com/msys2/msys2-installer/releases/download/2024-01-13/msys2-x86_64-20240113.exe) 

When running the installer, choose an installation directory; I recommend something along the lines of `C:\Development\Tools`, which will make finding it easier, but this is entirely up to you (you can always reinstall to a more convenient location later). Once completed, make sure to select **Run MSYS2 now**, then **Finish**. (Note: if for whatever reason you did not select **Run MSYS2 now**, you can always access this terminal later by simply searching for "MSYS2" in the Windows Start menu.)
#### Install the MinGW Toolset
The terminal that just opened is an MSYS2 terminal window, which can be reopened by searching for "MSYS2" in Windows search. In this terminal, run the following command:

```bash
pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain
```

For convenience, here is a break down of the command:
- `pacman` - Pacman is a package manager, which is an easy way to manage applications, libraries, and more in a convenient yet powerful way. You've been using `apt` in Ubuntu via WSL, which is the package manager used on that distro. Here, Pacman is used to install and update new tools; on an actual Linux distribution, like Arch or one of its derivatives, it is used to install/update all apps/libraries on the system, similar to apt. 
- `-S` - This just means `sync`, and you can also type `--sync` for the same result. It synchronizes your machine and the remote repository so that you pull the proper packages.
- `--needed` - This makes sure to install all dependencies of the packages you're installing.
- `base-devel`, `mingw-w64...` - These are the packages you're installing, which contains every tool you'll need to compile on Windows with GCC/G++. 

**NOTE: Every so often it's recommended to update your packages so that your toolchain is up to date.** This is as simple as opening the MSYS2 terminal and typing the following command: `pacman -Syu`. This syncs the database and updates all packages. 
### Update Windows PATH variable
Once Pacman has finished updating your packages, we just need to update your `PATH` variable in Windows, which is where applications must be registered in order to be called from the command line. Until you do this, you will not be able to simply run `g++` in the terminal like you do in WSL, and you would have to manually input the path to `g++.exe` every time you want to run it.  
1. In the Windows search bar, search for "edit the system environment variables".

![sysvar](./images/cpp-dev/WindowsSearchSysVar.png)

2. In the window that pops up, **System Properties**, select **Environment Variables**.

3. In your **User variables**, select the `Path` variable and then select **Edit**.

![editvar](./images/cpp-dev/EditEnvVar.png)

4. Select **New** and add the MinGW-w64 destination folder you used during the installation process. If you used the settings I recommended, for example, then this will be the path: `C:\Development\Tools\msys64\ucrt64\bin`.

![pathvar](./images/cpp-dev/AddPathVar.png)

5. Select **OK** to save the updated PATH. You will need to reopen any terminals (e.g. command prompt or PowerShell) for the command to be registered properly.

Finally, open a terminal and run the command `g++ --version` to make sure that it installed correctly and that the path variable is correct. If you run into issues, follow the  

### Setting up VSCode (pt. 2)
Now that MinGW/G++ is installed, we need to make sure VSCode uses it when providing syntax highlighting and error catching i.e. linting. To do this, go to your settings in VSCode, and search for the following property ID: `C_Cpp.default.compilerPath`. Click **Edit in Settings.json**, which will open the relevant .json file in the editor. Most likely, this property will be empty, but if not, simply replace it with the path to your G++ executable. Be sure to use double backslashes for separators, e.g. 
`"C:\\Development\\Tools\\msys64\\ucrt64\\bin\\g++.exe"`. Also make sure that the `includePath` variable is set to something like `"${workspaceFolder}/**"`, which will ensure that any files you add to your project will be discovered automatically. 

At this point, try writing a simple HelloWorld.cpp file using iostream to be sure that all libraries/compilers are in place and working. 

## Working with CMake and SFML
We're going to be installing CMake for this tutorial. Technically, if you just install SFML with the instructions shown later, you can use the compilation commands that the teacher provides. However, CMake allows for very nuanced configurations that are quite painful with manual terminal commands. In my final project, the order of compilation was very important, and simply running the compilation/linking command didn't work; it would require running several commands all at once, and even more if I had added more subfolders. CMake makes (hah) it so that you can press a single button, and everything just works. It's highly recommended for larger-scale projects.

### Installing CMake
Open a terminal and type the following command: 

```
winget install Kitware.cmake
```

[Winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) is a Windows package manager of sorts; while it's not as robust as something like Pacman or Apt, it's still a convenient way to install/update things without having to download an installer executable from a web browser. If for whatever reason the command is not available in your terminal, open the Microsoft Store and download the [App Installer](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nblggh4nns1?rtc=1&hl=en-us&gl=US#activetab=pivot:overviewtab) (or click the link to open a web browser; clicking on **Install** will open the Store to the right page automatically).

CMake will then be installed. 

### More VSCode Configuration
A complete CMake + VSCode guide can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/cmake-linux) (note that it says "on Linux", but the guide is also usable on Windows).

Download the [CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) extension for VSCode, which is an official Microsoft addon. Once it is installed, it is recommended to restart VSCode for it to fully take effect. 

### Finally, SFML
In a previous iteration of this guide, I showed off how to download the SFML source code and compile that for yourself for minimal compatibility issues. Unfortunately, their version of many libraries was built with MSVC, causing inconsistencies with G++ on Windows. Fortunately, MSYS2 allows us to download packages that pull the MinGW version of those libraries, and they work flawlessly.

In your MSYS2 UCRT terminal, run the following command to download SFML and all its dependencies. 

```
pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-sfml
```

### Configuring CMake

In the root directory, make a file called `CMakeLists.txt`. This is the script that is responsible for configuring everything build-related and also doing some file manipulation.

This is the `CMakeLists` file that I use:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
project(CmakeSFMLProject LANGUAGES CXX)

set(OPENAL_PATH "C:/Development/Tools/ucrt64/bin/libopenal-1.dll" CACHE PATH "Path to OpenAL directory")
# ^ Make sure to put the path to your libopenal.dll file here. It's necessary if your program uses sound!
# It's worth noting that this appears in your CMake cache as well, which can be edited in the VSCode GUI

set(CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin)
option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS "Build shared libraries" OFF)

file(GLOB_RECURSE SOURCES "src/*.cpp")
# This recursively compiles .cpp files, which is important for making sure they compile in the right order.

add_executable(<game name> ${SOURCES})
target_link_libraries(CmakeSFMLProject PRIVATE sfml-graphics sfml-audio sfml-window sfml-system)
# This is where the linking happens. 

target_compile_features(CmakeSFMLProject PRIVATE cxx_std_20)
# You can set your preferred C++ standard here, as well as other compiler parameters such as -Wall

if(WIN32)
    add_custom_command(
        TARGET Asteroids
        COMMENT "Copy OpenAL DLL"
        PRE_BUILD COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy "C:/msys64/ucrt64/bin/libopenal-1.dll" $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:CmakeSFMLProject>
        VERBATIM)
endif()
# This copies the OpenAl DLL to the bin folder.

install(TARGETS CmakeSFMLProject)
```

It might be a good place to start when building your own.

Once everything is done, your file structure should look something like this:

![codium](./images/cpp-dev/VSCodium_3WSl1ALh24.png)

Hit `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` to open your VSCode command palette, and run **CMake: Configure**, then **Scan for Kits**. (Note that in the provided screenshot, I have already scanned for kits; this list will be empty for you.)

![config](./images/cpp-dev/CmakeConfigure.png)

Once it's done scanning, select the CMake icon on the far left-hand side of VSCode (it looks like a triangle with a wrench icon). You will see two sections: **Project Status**, and **Project Outline**. 

Under **Project Status/Configure**, hover over **Configure** --> **\[No Kit Selected]** and hit the pen icon on the righthand side. This will open a selection window where you should see all compilers installed; simply select "GCC 13.2.0..." which is your G++ compiler.

![kit](./images/cpp-dev/SelectKit.png)

#### Building SFML and the Project
To test that everything is working as expected, copy the [green circle demo](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/start-linux.php#compiling-a-sfml-program) to `src/main.cpp`. Finally, select **Build** next to **Project Outline** --> **CMakeSFMLProject**, which will build the application and link the library properly. (Tip: You can also right click on this entry and select **Run in terminal**, which will build the project and run it automatically.)

![build](./images/cpp-dev/CMakeBuild.png)

If all compiles successfully, you should see the final executable `CMakeSFMLProject.exe` under `build/bin`, along with `openal32.dll`, which is the dynamic library required for it to run. Any subsequent tests will require you to re-build using the **CMakeSFMLProject** build button, or running **Build** under **Project Status**. One handy feature of Make (the build system that CMake configures) is that it doesn't compile *everything* unnecessarily. That means in a project with dozens of compilation units, a single change won't take 20+ seconds to recompile. 

## Done!

And that's everything! You should be completely set up for developing C++ on Windows for CS 151. Note that there are many nuances to this process compared to Linux that are outside the scope of this guide, but this should be plenty of info to have a good foundation.
